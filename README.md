# mini-assistant
 I made a personal desktop assistant using Python which help me to perform activities which i do in day to day life on my computer.
 this assistant can perform following activities only user has to enter the digit by which activity is related

What can this mini assistant do?
It can open wikipedia,google,youtube by just entering a single digit.
It can play music for you when you want to relax.
It can tell you time,day,date.
It can also give you weather detail of any city(before using this function you have to provide your weather API key)
It can also tell you the news headlines of the day with it's sources(but again,before using this function you have to provide your weather API key)
one of the good feature of this assistant is you can play snake,water and gun game with this assistant whenever you want.
